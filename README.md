Many.  Object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural.  It seems to be primarily used as a object-oriented (and imperative?) language though.

Unlike in javascript where you can 'add' a string and a number together, python does not silently change type to make an expression work but instead it will throw an error.

Python is a high level language.
#### Does it have built in memory management and garbage collection?
Yes, it has built in memory management and seems to have garbage collection by default which you can switch off if you want to.

#### What languages was Python influenced by?
Probably C, primarily.

#### Is it a compiled or interpeted language?
It seems to depend on how it is being implemented.  

#### Does it have strong support for functional programming?
It allows for functional programming but it doesn't seem to actively support it.  

#### What's the deal with Python 2 vs Python 3?
There are enough differences between the two that they are officially recognized as being essentially two different languages.
