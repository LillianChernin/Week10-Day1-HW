#### What paradigms does Python support?

Many.  Object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural.  It seems to be primarily used as a object-oriented (and imperative?) language though.

#### What typing discipline does it follow?
Unlike in javascript where you can 'add' a string and a number together, python does not silently change type to make an expression work but instead it will throw an error.  However, when you declare variables you don't need to explicitly declare its type nor will it prevent you from changing a variable from one type to another.

#### Is it a high or low level language?
Python is a high level language.

#### Does it have built in memory management and garbage collection?
Yes, it has built in memory management and seems to have garbage collection by default which you can switch off if you want to.

#### What languages was Python influenced by?
It seems to be influenced by C, primarily.

#### Is it a compiled or interpeted language?
It seems to depend on how it is being implemented.  It is primarily an interpreted language but from my reading it seems like compilers can be used with it too.

#### Does it have strong support for functional programming?
It allows for functional programming but it doesn't seem to actively support it.  

#### What's the deal with Python 2 vs Python 3?
There are enough differences between the two that they are officially recognized as being essentially two different languages - slightly different syntax, different modules, etc.

#### How do you open a REPL for Python?
You can type 'python' (for python 2) or 'python3' (for python 3) in the terminal and it will open a REPL.  The IDLE shell is also a REPL for python.

#### How does one execute a Python program?
You can run a python module in the IDLE shell.  You can run a python program in terminal by typing 'python3 filename.py'.
